The last cheat I ever created ( or well not really last, made one more after this but didn't finish that one ).
Releasing it because after selling one copy to someone, the person got it leaked to script kiddie. The script kiddie ended up copy pasting stuff and claiming credit for some of my code, so I decided to make it available for everyone.

It has some "new" cheat features that the scene might appreciate ( aka will probably be c+pd into every generic cheat ), but since it's already happening with 1 cheat,
it doesn't really matter. (update as of 2020: my prediction was right, they're now c+pd into every generic cheat )

The cheat used to work for csgo, tf2, gmod, css and it probably would've worked for many others.

Use it for whatever you want, just make sure to credit me.

There used to be a authentication in here which did some mean things. Make sure to look at the auth files and either disable it or change it to fit your own HWID code.
